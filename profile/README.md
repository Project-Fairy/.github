### Mediapipe

We used 'MediaPipe' for identifying object.<br>
MediaPipe is composed of Python and TensorFlow, and we implemented it using Colab.<br>
MediaPipe provides light model and easy to use in low-spec environments.<br>
It supports various platforms such as Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web.<br>
Also had the advantages of providing pre-optimized code, ready to use without complicated configuration processes, and free open source for cost-free use.

For more easier useage of trained model, an Android phone with a high penetration rate was used.<br>
The Android application was developed using Kotlin.<br>
